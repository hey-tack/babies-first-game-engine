# Baby's First Game Engine

My first attempt at a simple game engine in .NET Core, mostly supplemented by the material in [C# Game Programming for Serious Game Creation, by Daniel Schuller](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Programming-Serious-Creation/dp/1435455568).

Depends on the following technologies 
 - .NET Core 3.1
 - OpenTK
 - NUnit
 
Built using the following tools
 - Windows 10
 - VS Code 
 
# Running the project
 
_This project is in its earliest possible stages of infancy, and as of this moment I have no plans to expand it beyond the point at which it no longer supplements a useful or interesting experience for me. So I will not be accepting pull requests into this repository, however you are free to pull it down and do whatever you want with it._

Essentially, all you should need to do is install VS Code for your platform, pull down the repo, open VS Code in the folder of the project, and hit F5. 

Expect very little stability, and very ugly code.
